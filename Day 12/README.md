# Day 11 - Namespaces, Scope and Number guessing game 
    I have learned about scope of variables, what is and how to use global variables,
    global constants

## Day project Overview
The goal is to build a guess the number game.

## How It Works
- The game starts by displaying an ASCII art logo.


## Code Highlights
- **Functions with Docstrings**: Each part of the logic is written as a separate function with clear explanations using docstrings.


**However, I successfully completed the project only using hints 1 and 2.**
