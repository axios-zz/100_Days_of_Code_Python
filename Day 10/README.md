# Day 11 - Blackjack Game Project

## Project Overview
This Blackjack game is a console-based Python project where the user plays against the computer in a simplified version of the classic card game. The game includes fundamental Blackjack rules and allows repeated plays. This project was designed to implement and test everything I had learned so far, including functions, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, recursion, and basic logic structuring.

## How It Works
- The game starts by displaying an ASCII art logo.
- The user is prompted to start the game by typing 'y'.
- Both the player and the computer (dealer) are dealt two cards initially.
- The player can choose to draw more cards or pass.
- The dealer draws cards until the score reaches or exceeds 17.
- The result is then displayed based on who has a score closer to 21 without going over.
- After each round, the user is given the option to restart or exit the game.

## Code Highlights
- **Functions with Docstrings**: Each part of the logic is written as a separate function with clear explanations using docstrings.
- **Recursion**: The game uses recursion to restart the game smoothly without breaking the loop.
- **Input Handling**: Implemented user input for decision-making during the game.
- **Game Logic**: Includes rules like auto-draw for the computer if its score is below 17, win/loss conditions, and score comparisons.
- **Capstone Project**: the Project is a capstone project where all the things which I have learned so far has been used and implemented while building this project 
The project was designed with five progressive stages: Normal, Hard, Extra Hard, and Expert. Each stage provided hints to help complete the project.

**However, I successfully completed the project only using hints 1 and 2.**
